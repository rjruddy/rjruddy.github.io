                    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                    <p>I am Northwestern University class of 2024 with a major in Computer Science and a minor in French.
                        My primary interests lie in the intersection of art and technology, but I find fulfillment in
                        expanding my horizons and exploring new fields of tech. I have experience in both mobile and web UI/UX
                        design, game development, iOS and web development, as well as database management.</p>

                    <h3>What about beyond technology?</h3>
                    <p>When not developing and desigining, I like to pass my time with artistic pursuits, including acting, digital art, and music.
                         In the summer, you can find me acting as a part of RenQuest at the Bristol Renaissance Faire! You can also find some examples of my 
                         digital art in the Projects section.

                    <h3>What are my technical skills?</h3>
                    <p>I have experience picking up new languages and technologies on the fly from my time in university.
                        Below are some of the technical skills I have picked up on the way.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Languages: </b>Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C#, SQL, Java, Swift</li>
                        <li><b>Technologies: </b>Splunk, Jira, Git, AWS, Unity, Django, React, NextJS</li>
                        <li><b>Other: </b>Agile Design Methodology, RESTful APIs, Testing and Debugging</li>

                    <h3>What are my design skills?</h3>
                    <p>Beyond technology, I enjoy expressing myself through art and design. I have designed several
                        high-fidelity mobile and web app interface prototypes using <b>Figma</b>. I also have experience
                        taking a project through the full design lifecycle, from needfinding to paper prototyping to user testing. 
                        I believe in open-mindedness, and the value of quick iteration in finding long-term results.
